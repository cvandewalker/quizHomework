# quizHomework

##
for this project I was tasked with making a quiz game that could store high scores.

I made the quiz 10 questions long and set a 2 minute timer.

when the questions are all answered or when the timer runs out, a highscore div opens where you can type your initials and store your score.

when a question is answered wrong, the body color turns red and a point as added to the red score box. 
when a question is answered correct, the body turns green and a point is added to the green score box.
(I couldnt figure out how to color the background for just 1 second rather than permanently.)

the final score is the equal to the amount of correct answers minus the amount of wrong answers.
